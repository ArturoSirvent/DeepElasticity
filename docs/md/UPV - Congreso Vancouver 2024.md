In the quest for innovative approaches to tackle soft tissue and organ simulation, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) emerge as a promising tool. These algorithms provide a novel perspective on solving differential equations by utilizing neural networks to directly approach solutions associated with deformations, as opposed to traditional methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). This shift towards artificial intelligence in biomechanical modeling is part of the contemporary evolution in scientific research.
While Finite Element Methods (FEM) have been instrumental in tissue simulation, their applicability may be constrained in demanding scenarios like real time simulations. PINNs, on the other hand, present themselves as an alternative capable of overcoming these limitations by harnessing the neural networks' capacity to learn complex patterns, thus accelerating inference times.
  
In comparison to conventional data-driven approaches, which often necessitate extensive datasets for model training, we advocate for the utilization of Physics Informed Neural Networks. Our works delves into the potential of PINNs in solving differential equations for soft tissue deformation, with a particular focus on organs like the prostate. It examines how these neural networks can guide resolution based on underlying physical laws for both the direct and inverse problems, enabling faster and more efficient estimation of biomechanical parameters, turning them into trainable parameters of the network.

This research aims to advance the understanding and modeling of biomechanical phenomena, emphasizing its real-world application for tissue, and promoting the application of PINNs as an effective tool in this context, for future real-time and geometry-free soft tissue simulations in a clinical work environment.
